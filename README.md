# MW19_138_GSC_Wiki_Library

[ About ]


The GSCBIN Dump, GSC Injector, and GSC Dumper are based on the GSC Injection process devised by Mr. Sku-111 in Project Donetsk, which we have reconstructed and utilized.

I express my heartfelt respect and gratitude to Mr. Sku-111, who devised and implemented this injection process.

Additionally, the GSC Source is based on Mr. xensik's gsc-tool and has been decompiled.

Thank you always, and I support you.

[ Custom GSC ( gsc-tool ) ]

< dump >

* A "GSCBIN" folder containing the gscbin for iw8 needs to be placed in the same directory hierarchy as gsc-tool.exe.

gsc-tool -m decomp -g iw8 -s pc GSCBIN


< compile >

* A "GSCModSource" folder containing the custom GSC source for iw9 needs to be placed in the same directory hierarchy as gsc-tool.exe.

You are free to modify the GSC Mod Menu source code I released.

However, I will not provide explanations on how to modify GSC, coding methods, or basic coding knowledge.

Please figure it out on your own.
